What is this?
---------------
APCu/APC, is a free open-source opcode (operation code) caching plugin for PHP. If your host has installed APC/APCu cache this plugin allows you to clear the cache from within WordPress. Once activated, go to Tools -> APC Clear Cache to send the command to clear the APC/APCu cache. 

The plugin returns either 'Success' or gives a detailed error message if it is unable to run the command successfully.

Original Author: TJ Stein, inspired by 2020Media. 2020Media first created the plugin and 2020Media doesn't update their plugin since 3 years. For this reason I have released this plugin with some modifications.
